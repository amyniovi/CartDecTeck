# Project Title

Decision Tech Shopping Cart

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Just Clone my repo 

### Installing

If you run the web project, all you will get at the moment is a login form and you being able to login with your username. 
All implemented in Javascript, i just add the username in the cookies, with the session default expiry.
Once you log in you can check out your cookie in Dev Tools, sorry but thats about it so far. :(

I started implementing the client side with javascript just to practice but I havent completed the client side work,I still need to implement the UI.

I imlemented only the server side TDD Discount Logic for the cart. That is complete.

## Running the tests

Once you download please use VS NUnit test runner to run the unit tests. 

### Break down into end to end tests

I have only tested for the cases provided not for any extra edge cases, like no products  etc.

Ideally the Repo for the shopping carts needs to be a concurrent collection which is what i will implement next, 
atm we only have one cart
```
We are not looking at available stock in this project.
